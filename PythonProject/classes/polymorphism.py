# # Polymorphism in Python
# The
# word
# polymorphism
# means
# having
# many
# forms.In
# programming, polymorphism
# means
# same
# function
# name(but
# different
# signatures) being
# uses
# for different types.
#
# Example
# of
# inbuilt
# polymorphic
# functions:
#
# # Python program to demonstrate in-built poly-
# # morphic functions
# # len() being used for a string
# print(len("geeks"))
#
# # len() being used for a list
# print(len([10, 20, 30]))
# Output:
# 5
# 3
# Examples
# of
# used
# defined
# polymorphic
# functions:
#
#
# # A simple Python function to demonstrate
# # Polymorphism
#
# def add(x, y, z=0):
#     return x + y + z
#
#
# # Driver code
# print(add(2, 3))
# print(add(2, 3, 4))
# Output:
#
# 5
# 9

# # Polymorphism with class methods:
# Below
# code
# shows
# how
# python
# can
# use
# two
# different
#
#
# class types, in the same way.We create a for loop that iterates through a tuple of objects.
# Then call the methods without being concerned about which class type each object is.
# We assume that these methods actually exist in each class.
#
#
# class India():
#     def capital(self):
#         print("New Delhi is the capital of India.")
#
#     def language(self):
#         print("Hindi is the most widely spoken language of India.")
#
#     def type(self):
#         print("India is a developing country.")
#
#
# class USA():
#     def capital(self):
#         print("Washington, D.C. is the capital of USA.")
#
#     def language(self):
#         print("English is the primary language of USA.")
#
#     def type(self):
#         print("USA is a developed country.")
#
#
# obj_ind = India()
# obj_usa = USA()
# for country in (obj_ind, obj_usa):
#     country.capital()
#     country.language()
#     country.type()
# Output:
# New
# Delhi is the
# capital
# of
# India.
# Hindi is the
# most
# widely
# spoken
# language
# of
# India.
# India is a
# developing
# country.
# Washington, D.C. is the
# capital
# of
# USA.
# English is the
# primary
# language
# of
# USA.
# USA is a
# developed
# country.

# # Polymorphism with Inheritance:
# In
# Python, Polymorphism
# lets
# us
# define
# methods in the
# child
#
#
# class that have the same name as the methods in the parent class.In inheritance,
# the child class inherits the methods from the parent class.However,
# it is possible to modify a method in a child class that it has inherited from the parent class.
# This is particularly useful in cases where the method inherited from the parent class
# doesn’t quite fit the child class.In such cases, we re-implement the method in the child class.
# This process of re-implementing a method in the child class is known as Method Overriding.
#
#
# class Bird:
#     def intro(self):
#         print("There are many types of birds.")
#
#     def flight(self):
#         print("Most of the birds can fly but some cannot.")
#
#
# class sparrow(Bird):
#     def flight(self):
#         print("Sparrows can fly.")
#
#
# class ostrich(Bird):
#     def flight(self):
#         print("Ostriches cannot fly.")
#
#
# obj_bird = Bird()
# obj_spr = sparrow()
# obj_ost = ostrich()
#
# obj_bird.intro()
# obj_bird.flight()
#
# obj_spr.intro()
# obj_spr.flight()
#
# obj_ost.intro()
# obj_ost.flight()
# Output:
# There
# are
# many
# types
# of
# birds.
# Most
# of
# the
# birds
# can
# fly
# but
# some
# cannot.
# There
# are
# many
# types
# of
# birds.
# Sparrows
# can
# fly.
# There
# are
# many

# # Polymorphism with a Function and objects:
# It is also
# possible
# to
# create
# a
# function
# that
# can
# take
# any
# object, allowing
# for polymorphism.In this example, let’s create a function called “func()” which will take an object
# which we will name “obj”.Though we are using the name ‘obj’, any instantiated object will be
# able to be called into this function.Next, lets give the function something to do that uses the
# ‘obj’ object we passed to it.In this case lets call the three methods, viz., capital(), language()
# and type(), each of which is defined in the two classes ‘India’ and ‘USA’.Next, let’s create
# instantiations of both the ‘India’ and ‘USA’ classes if we don’t have them already.With those,
# we can call their action using the same func() function:
#
#
# def func(obj):
#     obj.capital()
#     obj.language()
#     obj.type()
#
#
# obj_ind = India()
# obj_usa = USA()
#
# func(obj_ind)
# func(obj_usa)
